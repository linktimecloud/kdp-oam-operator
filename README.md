# kdp-oam-operator
The kdp-oam-operator, based on the KDP (Kubernetes Data Platform) bigdata model, provides a highly programmable application-centric delivery model. It allows users to build upon the fundamental capabilities of the kdp-oam-operator to extend and customize their services. The most critical components in the kdp-oam-operator are the XDefinition, Application, BDC, ContextSetting, and ContextSecret. All of these are built upon the fundamental structure of the Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) model and manage the resource lifecycle through the implementation of independent controller components.
